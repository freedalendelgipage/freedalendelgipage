Your forbearance options with private student loans will vary by lender, but they are generally less flexible than those available with federal student loans.

Many private lenders extend a forbearance option while you are in school or taking part in an internship or medical residency. Some let you make interest-only payments while in school. In-school forbearance typically has a time limit, which could create problems if you take longer than four years to graduate. Some lenders also offer a six-month grace period after graduation.

Some private lenders grant a forbearance if you are unemployed or are having difficulty making payments after you graduate. Typically, these are granted for two months at a time for no longer than 12 months in total. There may be an additional fee for each month you are in forbearance.
