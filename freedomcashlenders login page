With all student loan forbearance, interest on your loan continues to accrue during the deferral period and is usually capitalized (added to the loan amount owed) at the end of the deferral period unless you pay the interest as it accrues.

Federal Student Aid. “Student Loan Forbearance.”

Perkins Loans are an exception to the capitalization rule. With a Perkins Loan, your interest accrues during the deferral period but is not capitalized. Instead, it is added to the interest balance (not the principal) during repayment, unless you pay it as it accrues. (Although the U.S. government stopped offering Perkins Loans in 2017, many people are still paying back what they borrowed through these loans.)

Federal student loan forbearance is usually granted for 12 months at a time and can be renewed for up to three years. Conditions and payment amounts for some types of federal student loan forbearance are mandated by law. In other instances, the loan servicer has discretion.
